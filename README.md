# Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a simple blog-like application developed using **React.js** for the frontend and **Django** for the backend. The application allows users to create, view, and delete blog posts. The frontend and backend communicate via a RESTful API.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used here to create the interactive frontend.
- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend API.
- **React Router**: A collection of navigational components that integrate declaratively with the application.

### Backend

- **Django**: A high-level Python web framework for clean, pragmatic design.
- **Django REST Framework**: A toolkit for building Web APIs.
